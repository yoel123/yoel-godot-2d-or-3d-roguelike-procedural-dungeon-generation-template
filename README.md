# the yoel godot 2d or 3d roguelike procedural dungeon generation template

made with godot version 3.5.2
used kenny Micro Roguelike 2d tiles for 2d art

the goal of this project is to give the godot comunity an example of how to create
random dungeon levels (for a rouglike game etc) whether they want to make a 2d or 3d game.
i have an example use of my algorithem for both.
also pathfinding example for both using godot navigation.
and a player controler.

## features: 
*2d:

-generate 2d random dungeon 

-2d player controller: free move ,grid move , pathfinding move.
thers also a draw function for pathfinding nodes.

-zoom in and out (with + - keys)

*3d:

-generate 2d random dungeon 

-fps controller

-"follow pet": to demonstrate 3d pathfinding (for ai )

-zoom in and out (with + - keys)

also for both 3d and 2d check how i convert tilemap pos to screen pos.
and check the scale for the 2d tiles and the 3d baked navmash (its baked at runtime and there is no guide online or any other example doing that).

i will have to do a video explaining this and/or using this template.
